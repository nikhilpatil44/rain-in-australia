# Rain in Australia
Logistic regression is used for the forcasting of rain in Australia.

## Problem Statement
We will try to answer the question that whether or not it will rain tomorrow in Australia. We implement Logistic Regression with Python and Scikit-Learn.

## Dataset
The dataset is taken from a Kaggle. You can download the dataset from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/jsphyg/weather-dataset-rattle-package)

## Approach
- Downloading a real-world dataset from Kaggle
- Exploratory data analysis and visualization
- Splitting a dataset into training, validation & test sets
- Filling/imputing missing values in numeric columns
- Scaling numeric features to a $(0,1)$ range
- Encoding categorical columns as one-hot vectors
- Training a logistic regression model using Scikit-learn
- Evaluating a model using a validation set and test set
- Saving a model to disk and loading it back
